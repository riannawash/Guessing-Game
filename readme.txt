A guessing game where I implemented a binary Tree with answers to a quiz. In my specific example it is “Favorite Musical Artist ” and the user is prompted with questions in which they input “Y” or “N” in order to reach an artist that suits all of their interests.
Utilized Java and Visual Studio Code
